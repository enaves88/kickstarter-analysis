# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
Assignment 1: Using Excel to Analyze Kickstarter Campaign Trends
The Following trends were found which can be useful towards makinng Kickstarter funding decisions:
* Campaigns begun in the Months of May, June and July are more successful in reaching funding goal.
* !Outcomes_Based_on_Launch_Date](path/to/Outcomes_Based_on_Launch_Date.png)
* Successful campaigns in the US tended to have lower goals.
* There is a higher probability of getting a play funded in Great Britain than the United States
* There are roughly twice as many Kickstarter campaigns in the US than Great Britain
## Recommendation
It is my recommendation that beginning a Kickstarter campaign in the US is a valid taking the following criteria into account:
* The campaign begins in between May and June.
* The campaign aims at smaller pledge donations from a large donor pool.
* The campaign should have a goal under $6,000.
